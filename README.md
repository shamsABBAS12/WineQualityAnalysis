- Leveraged Optuna to fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model selection.
- Addressed class imbalance effectively with SMOTE.
- Deployed a user-friendly app interface using Streamlit on the Hugging Face platform.


üåü Core Features
- Input wine characteristics to predict its quality instantly.
- Compare performance across multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Real-time and interactive results.
- Simple, intuitive interface for seamless user interaction.


üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- Python for backend programming.
- Pandas and NumPy for handling and processing data.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn for developing machine learning models.
